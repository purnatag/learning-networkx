I coded up Leetcode Problems like Evaluate Division, All Paths from Source to Target etc using networkx python package for practise, as Leetcode does not allow importing of packages. 
* ### All Paths from Source to Target: 
Medium Leetcode problem, solution uses DFS with memoization.
* ### Course Schedule: 
Medium Leetcode problem, straightforward topological sort.
* ### Valid Path: 
Medium Leetcode problem of detecting the presence of a valid path from source labelled 0 to destination labelled n-1. Solution uses DFS.
* ### Evaluate Division: 
Medium Leetcode problem. Solution uses all pairs shortest path algorithm of Floyd, Warshall. Version with networkx usage and without, included here.
* ### Visualising Basic Polynomial: 
Plotted the arithmetic circuit for xy+yz+xz using networkx.
